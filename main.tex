\title{All-optical AND gate using photonic crystal quantum dot semiconductor optical amplifiers}

\author{T. Matsumoto, G. Hosoya and H. Yashima}

\abstract{All-optical logic gates(AOLGs) are composed of all-optical devices which can operate as well as transistor under high-speed bit rates and essential for all optical communication network. Althought many researches on AOLGs have been demonstrated, discussions about the circuit integration are few. In this paper, we propose all optical AND gate using photonic crystal quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifiers(PC-QDSOA) and numerically analyze the input-output characteristics at 160Gb/s. Moreover, in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed gate, we compare the proposed gate with conventional one in terms of degree of integration, energy consumption and performance.}

\section{Introduction}
% 全般的な話
High-speed and large capacity data transmission is required to cope with expanding network traffic data{\cite{qdsoa_ethernet}}. In current optical network, optical signal goes to destination through optical fiber with being affected by noise. Thus, re-amplification, re-timing and re-shaping operations are essential for reliable optical network. These days, electronic devices realize these operations and the problems are their processing speed limitation and energy consumption required for optic-electric/electric-optic conversion{\cite{3r_regeneration}}. In order to cope with these problems, all-optical signal processing is required and many researchers worked on and developed all-optical devices which realize this technology.
% QDSOAについての話
QDSOA is one of these devices which can be useful in many applications because of it's fast gain recovery time and nonlinear optics effect{\cite{qdsoa_aosp}}. QD's confinement of electrons and electron holes enables fast gain recovery and SOA's gain saturation enables nonlinear optics effect, respectively.
% PCについての話
On the other hand, the PC is a dielectric material which consists of two different refractive indexes periodically. The lightwaves in specific bandwidth cannot propagate through the PC. PC waveguides(PCWs) use this characteristic which can be obtained PC slab with creating a line defect. They can confine the lightwaves perpendicular and parallel to the direction of lightwaves propagation. Moreover, their dispersion relation can slow down lightwaves which can be useful when they are combined with SOA or QDSOA. \par
% AOLGsについての話
AOLGs are the applications of all-optical devices which can operate binary inputs. Although many AOLGs using various all-optical devices have been developed, the length of these gates is larger than one of electrical logic gates because all-optical devices require certain length to operate as a component of AOLGs. For instance, a length of QDSOA is about 2mm{\cite{qdsoa_nssm}}, whereas the one of transistors, used for commercially available electronic devices, is about 14nm{\cite{current_cpu}}.
% 研究の意義・これからやることの説明
Few researches discuss about the length of device which is important factor for developing high-density integrated and less energy consumption device. Thus, we propose PC-QDSOA assisted all-optical AND gate. AND gate plays an important role for multiplexer and demultiplexer circuits whose applications are communication system, computer memory and arithmetic logic unit. To our knowledge, there is no research about numerically analyzing PC-QDSOA assisted all-optical AND gate. The results in this paper show that the realization of the all-optical AND gate is feasible with the proposed PC-QDSOA assisted all-optical AND gate at 160Gb/s.

\section{PC-QDSOA model}
% PC-QDSOAの構成について
The PC-QDSOAs used in this study are composed of GaAs, ${\rm{In_{0.15}Ga_{0.85}As}}$ and InAs as an active region to enhance optical power around ${\rm{1.3\mu m}}${\cite{theory_of_qdsoa}}. The population inversion in the active regions of amplifiers is achieved by passing current through laterally doped ${\rm{p^{+}-p-n^{+}}}$ structures. Also, the waveguide of the PC-QDSOA is W1 PCW wherein slow light can be achieved with either zero group velocity dispersion and zero third order dispersion in specific bandwidth. The waveguide can be achieved by creating a line defect in a slab PC and tuning structural parameter{\cite{how_to_create_pcw}}. The schematic diagram of PC-QDSOA waveguide is illustrated in Fig.{\ref{fig:pcqdsoa}}.

% PC-QDSOAがレート方程式で理論解析できることを説明
The operation of the PC-QDSOAs can be theoretically studied by means of a rate equation model{\cite{pcqdsoa}}. InAs QDs consists of a ground state (GS), an excited state (ES), and an upper state (US). A quantum well (QW) is common carrier reservoir for QDs. Due to variability in the size and shape of QDs with use of Stranski-Krastanov mode, the carrier dynamics in the QDs can be described by 1088 variables. Thus, a rate equation of the PC-QDSOA is as follows:

\endgroup
The term $f^{c(v)}_{w}$ represents the carrier occupancy of the QW. Likewise, $f^{c(v)}_{u,j},f^{c(v)}_{e,j},f^{c(v)}_{g,j}$ represents the carrier occupancy of the $j$th group of US, ES, and GS respectively. The term $\Gamma_{k}$ is the optical confinement factor at wavelength $\lambda_{k}$. The term $P_{k,in}$ and $P_{p}$ represents the power of the $k$th photon mode and probe signal, respectively. The term $\alpha(\lambda)$ represents the loss coefficient at a wavelength $\lambda$ which can be the sum of scattering and absorption losses. The term $g_{mod}(t,\lambda_{k})$ is the linear modal gain affected by slow light and can be expressed as the product of slowdown factor, optical confinement factor, and linear material gain of the active region. The term $g^{g(e)}_{j,k}$ is the linear optical gain that the GS (ES) of the $j$-th QD group gives to the $k$-th photon mode is given.
More details about the PC-QDSOA can be found in {\cite{pcqdsoa}}.

\section{AND gate model}
The schematic diagram of the PC-QDSOA assisted all-optical AND gate is shown in Fig.{\ref{fig:and_gate}}. The AND operation principle is as follows: a modulated data signal A (at wavelength $\lambda_{A}$) and a clock signal (at wavelength $\lambda_{C}$) are injected into the PC-QDSOA1. Then the signal A will induce less gain amplification on a clock signal via cross-gain modulation(XGM) in the PC-QDSOA1 and the logic outcome is NOT A. In the same way as this operation, a modulated data signal NOT A (at wavelength $\lambda_{C}$) and a modulated data signal B (at wavelength $\lambda_{B}$, which can be the same as the wavelength of data A) are injected into the PC-QDSOA2 and the logic outcome is A AND B.

\section{Results}
% 数値解析方法

% ER,Qについての説明
To evaluate the proposed gate, we use eye diagram, extinction ratio(ER) and Q-factor as appropriate metrics. The extinction ratio can be represented as $ER[dB] = 10\log_{10} \left(P^{1}_{min} / P^{0}_{max} \right)$. $P^{1}_{min}$ represents minimum power of signal ``1'' and $P^{0}_{max}$ represents maximum power of signal ``0''. The Q-factor can be represented as $Q = (S_{1}-S_{0})/(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{0})${\cite{q_factor}} where $S_{1},S_{0}$ are the average power of signal ``1'' and ``0'' and $\sigma_{1},\sigma_{0}$ are the standard deviations of those signals.  \par
% 入出力結果
Fig.{\ref{fig:output_signal}} shows the analysis results of the input-output characteristics when current injection is 6mA. Fig.{\ref{fig:eye_dia}} shows an eye diagram of the output signal. The ER and Q-factor of the output signal are 8.58 dB and 7.41, respectively. From these results, it is said that the proposed gate can operate as an AND gate at 160 Gb/s{\cite{extinction_ratio}}.

% 注入電流を変えたときの結果
On the other hand, because the gain recovery time varies due to the power of current injection, we have investigated on the effect on power of current injection to the proposed AND gate. Fig.{\ref{fig:pcqdsoa_different_pump_current_ERs}} and Fig.{\ref{fig:pcqdsoa_different_pump_current_Qs}} show the ERs and Q-factors of the output signals under different current injection, respectively. The ER and Q-factor are improving with increasing current injection because pattern-effect is decreasing. When current injection is over 9mA, there is few change in ERs because the maximum gain recovery time is limited by carrier relaxation time and capture time.

\newpage

% TODO::QDSOAとの比較結果
In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed gate, we have compared the proposed AND gate with the one QDSOA assisted, whose schematic diagram is same as the proposed one. The physical parameters and numerical analysis method of QDSOA can be found in {\cite{qdsoa_nssm}}. Fig.{\ref{fig:comp_ERs}} and fig.{\ref{fig:comp_Qs}} show the comparison of current injection required to obtain each ERs and Q-factors for QDSOA assisted AND gate and the proposed one, respectively. From fig.{\ref{fig:comp_ERs}}, it is said that to obtain ER about 7.5dB, QDSOA assisted AND gate requires 3000mA, whereas the proposed AND gate requires only 5mA. Likewise, from fig.{\ref{fig:comp_Qs}}, to obtain Q-factor about 5, QDSOA assisted AND gate requires 2800mA, whereas the proposed AND gate requires only 4mA. Moreover, the device length of the QDSOA is 2mm, whereas the one of the PC-QDSOA is 125${\rm{\mu m}}$. From these results, less energy consumption and less volume AND gate can be obtained with use of the proposed gate.

\section{Conclusion}
We have proposed PC-QDSOA assisted all-optical AND gate operating at 160Gb/s and evaluated the performance of the proposed gate by using eye diagram, ER and Q-factor. The results show the proposed gate can operate as AND gate at 160Gb/s when current injection is over 6mA and better performance can be achieved with increasing current injection because pattern-effect decreases.
