\section*{Abstract}

All-optical logic gates(AOLGs) are composed of all-optical devices which can operate as well as transistor under ultrafast bit rates and essential for all optical communication network. Althought many researches on AOLGs have been demonstrated, discussions about the volume reduction or less energy consuming are few. In this paper, we propose all optical AND gate using photonic crystal quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifiers(PC-QDSOA) and numerically analyze the input-output characteristics at a 160Gb/s. Moreover, in order to show the effectiveness of proposed gate, we compare the proposed gate with conventional one in terms of volume reduction, energy consumption and performance.

The demand of telecommunications is grown with the spread of mobile phone users. To cope with the demand, ultrafast light wave communications and networks are essential. In current optical communication network, signal processing technology is used for electrical signal only, and thus, processing electric signal limits the efficiency of current optical communication network{\cite{App}}. So, all optical signal processing  without electrical processing has been developed and the development of all optical devices are required. In recent researches, 

To our knowledge, there is no research about numerically analyzing PC-QDSOA assisted all-optical AND gate. The results in this paper show that the realization of the all-optical AND gate is feasible with the proposed PC-QDSOA assisted all-optical AND gate at 160Gb/s.

\subsection{All Optical AND Gate}
Fig.{\ref{figure:xor_gate}} shows the configuration of all optical AND gate using quantum dot semiconductor optical amplifier(QD-SOA){\cite{Omar}}--{\cite{Ultrafast}}. Two QD-SOA devices and 3dB couplers compose all optical XOR gate. QD-SOA is an optical device used for optical amplifier and modulates phase of output optical signal depending on input optical signal strength.

First, the $1 \times 2$ coupler separates clock signal into two waveguides. The clock signal traveling through the upper waveguide and the lower waveguide are fed into the QD-SOA1 and QD-SOA2, respectively. The QD-SOA1 and QD-SOA2 modulate the phase of clock signal by $\phi_{A}$ and $\phi_{B}$ according to input optical signal A and B, respectively. If the phase of the output signal of QD-SOA1 is equal to that of QD-SOA2, the output signals are coupled by the $2 \times 1$ coupler and cancel each other, and thus, the output of the coupler is ``0''. If the phase of the output signal of the QD-SOA1 is different from that of the QD-SOA2 by $\pi$, the output signals are coupled by $2 \times 1$ coupler and the output signal is obtained as ``1''. Thus, table {\ref{table:xor_table}} shows a truth table of all optical XOR gate.

\subsection{Horizontal and Vertical Parity Checks}
Fig.{\ref{figure:checks}} shows the placement of horizontal and vertical parity checks. We use 8-bit-length checks composed of 4-bit-length data and 4-bit-length parity. $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ are referred to as data bit and $x_5,x_6,x_7,x_8$ are referred to as parity bit. Parity bits are calculated as the following equation.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_5 = x_1 \oplus x_2 \\
  x_6 = x_3 \oplus x_4 \\
  x_7 = x_1 \oplus x_3 \\
  x_8 = x_2 \oplus x_4 
\end{eqnarray}

  \includegraphics[width=22mm]{Parity.eps}
  \caption{Horizontal and vertical parity checks}
  \label{figure:checks}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Encoder}
Fig.{\ref{figure:encoder}} shows the block diagram of the encoder. First, the $1 \times 5$ splitter separates information signal into five waveguides. The four of five waveguides are used for generating parity. Delay elements are used to adjust the timing of each data bits and they are fed into the $1 \times 2$ splitters. Each XOR gates generate one bit of parity and after delaying each bits, the $4 \times 1$ power combiner combines each bits to convert the parallel signal to serial one. Finally, the $2 \times 1$ power combiner combines transmitted signal and generated parity to generate encoded code.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=80mm]{Encoder.eps}
  \caption{The block diagram of encoder}
 \label{figure:encoder}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Decoder}
Fig.{\ref{figure:decoder}} shows the block diagram of the decoder. First, the $1 \times 3$ splitter separates received signal into three waveguides. Filter1 picks out only the parity bits in received signal and filter2 picks out only the data bits in received signal. The data bits outputted from filter2 generate parity. The received parity and the generated parity are fed into XOR gate to generate error pattern. We can find out which bit is wrong according to error pattern. If one of the data bits in received signal is wrong, error pattern has two bits whose power is ``1''. The error pattern signal is fed into the $1 \times 4$ splitter and signals travel through four waveguides. After delay elements adjust the timing of each data bits and they are fed into the $1 \times 2$ splitters, AND gates  generate the signal representing which bit is error. The $4 \times 1$ power combiner combines generated signal to convert parallel signal to serial one. Finally, the generated signal and received signal are fed into XOR gate to generate error corrected code.

\section{Results and Discussion}
We use Optisystem14.0.0 and MATLAB R2014a to numerically analyze the behavior of each optical devices at 160Gbps. We use rate equation and nonlinear state space model (NSSM) to numerically analyze QD-SOA{\cite{Rostami}}. The parameters used for the QDSOA  and PC-QDSOA in this paper are shown in {\cite{qdsoa},\cite{pcqdsoa}}.


Fig.{\ref{figure:send_compare}} shows the information signal fed into the encoder and the encoded signal at the encoder output. The information signal patterns are ``1110'' and ``0110'' as shown in fig.{\ref{figure:send_compare}(a), and the encoded signal patterns are ``11100101'' and ``01101111'' as shown in fig.{\ref{figure:send_compare}}(b). Fig.{\ref{figure:passive_compare}} shows a received signal and decoded signal. The received signal patterns are ``11110101'' and ``00101111'' as shown in fig.{\ref{figure:passive_compare}}(a). Fig.{\ref{figure:passive_compare}}(a) shows error added received signal corresponding to fig.{\ref{figure:send_compare}}(b). The fourth bit of first pattern is error turned from ``0'' to ``1'' and the second bit of second pattern is error turned from ``1'' to ``0''. The first pattern and second pattern of the decoded signal are ``11100101'' and ``01101111'' respectively, as shown in fig.{\ref{figure:passive_compare}}(b). As a result, the encoder generates code and the decoder corrects error occurred signal at 160Gbps.

We use eye diagram and obtain extinction ratio as appropriate metrics. The equation of extinction ratio is $ER(dB)=10log_{10}(P^{1}_{\min}/P^{0}_{\max})$ where $P^{1}_{\min}$ is minimum power of signal representing ``1'' and $P^{0}_{\max}$ is maximum power of signal representing ``0''. Fig.{\ref{figure:eyedia}} shows an eye diagram of the decoded signal. We show the proposed system is effective according to 5.72(dB) extinction ratio{\cite{Gayen}}.

\section{Conclusion}
We have proposed an all optical encoder and decoder for error correcting code using horizontal and vertical parity checks and numerically analyzed the proposed system. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system by using eye diagram and extinction ratio. As a result, the proposed encoder and decoder obtain an encoded code and error corrected signal at 160Gbps, respectively, and it is shown that the proposed encoder and decoder obtain sufficient extinction ratio.
